# Perfect Nextjs + Supabase

- use React Server Components as much as possible and use Server Actions where it makes sense
- In dynamic pages params have to be always awaited
- Do not make changes to the database in client components, only requests are allowed
- Use Supabase as the database 
- put components into `@/components` and sort them based on feature category

Do this:
```tsx
export default async function DemoPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;
  // more code
}
```
Do NOT do this:
```tsx
export default async function DemoPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { id: string };
}) {
  const { id } = params;
  // more code
}
```
